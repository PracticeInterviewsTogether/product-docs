# MVP Vision
For the MVP, we just want to target DSA and System Design Interview prep.

---

### What is this platform useful for

1. Find peers who want to improve their interviewing skills.

2. Practice coding and system design interviews with each other.

3. Keep track of performance in your interviews and improve.


### Existing Solutions/Competitors

1. [pramp.com](https://pramp.com/) : not personalized. random matches.

2. [interviewing.io](interviewing.io) : price too damn high.


### Product USPs

- Friend requests driven for compatibility : When you find a potential interview partner, they need to accept your friend request first.

- Search page : Quality recommendation system to suggest you the right candidates. Can also filter candidates based on other features.

- Tracking History : Ability to track your history and visually see your progress (see the wireframes [here](practiceinterviewstogether.com)).


### Marketing and Positioning

- The platform will also consolidate free/cheap resources for preparation (YouTube playlists, not AlgoExpert subscriptions). This aligns with our position as an accessible, no-nonsense solution.
