# MVP Vision
For the MVP, we just want to target DSA and System Design Interview prep.

---

### What is this platform useful for

1. Find peers who want to improve their interviewing skills.

2. Practice coding and system design interviews with each other.

3. Keep track of performance in your interviews and improve.


### Existing Solutions/Competitors

1. [pramp.com](https://pramp.com/) : not personalized. random matches.

2. [interviewing.io](interviewing.io) : price too damn high.

3. [interview bit](https://www.interviewbit.com/peer-mock-interview/) : gotta try this. claims to match you with the best peers after you fill out your information.

### Product USPs

- Friend requests driven for compatibility : When you find a potential interview partner, they need to accept your friend request first.

- Search page : Quality recommendation system to suggest you the right candidates. Can also filter candidates based on other features.

- Tracking History : Ability to track your history and visually see your progress (see the wireframes [here](practiceinterviewstogether.com)).


### Marketing and Positioning

- The platform will also consolidate free/cheap resources for preparation (YouTube playlists, not AlgoExpert subscriptions). This aligns with our position as an accessible, no-nonsense solution. See [this page](https://www.practiceinterviewstogether.com/services-7).

### Additional Features
* People shouldn't have to put in their LinkedIn profile. There should be a basic level of anonymity, like in LeetCode. You have a profile, but it doesn't reflect anything about who you really are. Only keep info like YoE, Target Role, Interview Type, etc.
